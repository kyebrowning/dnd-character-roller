# dnd-character-roller

Hiya and welcome to my DnD Character Roller!

https://kyebrowning.github.io/dnd-character-roller/

I mainly built this as an NPC roller as I DM a lot of games and have difficulty coming up with new character combinations. 

In this version, only characters and classes from PHB are avaialbe and stats are generated using a spread of numbers from 8-15. Racial trait bonus have not been added to the generated numbers.


### Goals for the Future

* Be able to select/add different books' classes and races to the PHB list.
* Generate HP stat.
* Add racial traits to generated stat list.
* Add other RPG games for character creation (Pathfinder, Star Wards, Star Finder, etc).
* Move all character info to an API.
* Move to a framework and build into an app that can be used on mobile.
* Update UI and general site aethestic.
* Generate more character details like name, character background, professions/hobbies, etc.
* Add the ability to select the character's level and have and stats scale with level.
* If the character has access to spells, randomly generate a list of spells.
* If the character has access to subclasses or schools of , randomaly generate.
